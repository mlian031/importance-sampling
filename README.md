# Importance Sampling

The goal of this program is to optimize the drift parameter of the geometric brownian motion for out-the-money options. The model of the underlying asset movement accounts for both continuous diffusion and discrete jumps in asset prices; however, the jump related parameters are set to zero in this program.
